For this project it is enough\nto use [GitHub Settings](https://github.com/smykhailov/the-businessman/settings/pages) to publish the site.\n\n![GitHub Pages](./images/2023-08-28-publish-to-github-pages/github-pages.jpg)\n\nJust select the `master` branch and click on the `Save` button. It is as easy as that.\nYou will see a message that says \"Your site is ready to be published at https://username.github.io/reponame/\"\nwhere username is your GitHub username and reponame is your repository name.\n\nIn my case it is located on [The Businssman](https://smykhailov.github.io/the-businessman/) repository page.\nFor now, it is empty, but it will be updated as soon as I push the changes to the `master` branch. But as I referenced\nJavaScript file which writes to console, we can open browser Dev Tools and see that message in the console.\n\n![The Businessman Empty Site](./images/2023-08-28-publish-to-github-pages/the-site.jpg)\n\nBehind the scene GitHub Pages uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to build your site. And creates [GitHub Actions workflow](https://github.com/smykhailov/the-businessman/actions/workflows/pages/pages-build-deployment),\nwhich executes everytime the change is pushed to the `master` branch.\n\nIn the next artecle I will create the main screen for our game.\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Publish to GitHub pages","date":"2023-08-28T17:08:00.000Z","tags":["businessman","project"],"keywords":["github","github pages","github actions","publish website"],"featuredImage":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/c3275d7770d4ec6ffb873299632f94a8/e184d/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/static/c3275d7770d4ec6ffb873299632f94a8/7dc31/cover.jpg 150w,\n/static/c3275d7770d4ec6ffb873299632f94a8/3aa92/cover.jpg 300w,\n/static/c3275d7770d4ec6ffb873299632f94a8/e184d/cover.jpg 600w,\n/static/c3275d7770d4ec6ffb873299632f94a8/cf7ea/cover.jpg 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/c3275d7770d4ec6ffb873299632f94a8/dafea/cover.webp 150w,\n/static/c3275d7770d4ec6ffb873299632f94a8/f031f/cover.webp 300w,\n/static/c3275d7770d4ec6ffb873299632f94a8/66310/cover.webp 600w,\n/static/c3275d7770d4ec6ffb873299632f94a8/1b4c0/cover.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"}]},"width":600,"height":465}}}},"internal":{"contentFilePath":"/home/runner/work/sergii-dev/sergii-dev/articles/2023-08-28-publish-to-github-pages.mdx"},"fields":{"slug":"/articles/publish-to-github-pages/","readingTime":{"text":"2 min read","minutes":1.245,"time":74700}}}},"pageContext":{"id":"060318ae-b227-582b-8bc1-c2f5df290c7c","frontmatter":{"title":"Publish to GitHub pages","date":"2023-08-28T17:08:00.000Z","published":true,"featuredImage":"./images/2023-08-28-publish-to-github-pages/cover.jpg","categories":["Businessman"],"tags":["businessman","project"],"keywords":["github","github pages","github actions","publish website"]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1739528850","3446427935"],"slicesMap":{}}
