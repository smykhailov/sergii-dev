[HTML](/articles/html-minimum-required-knowledge) instructs browser what and where to display, but CSS is responsible for the look and feel of the web page. It is the language that describes the style of an HTML document. CSS describes how HTML elements should be displayed. This article will cover the minimum required knowledge to start working with CSS.\n\n## CSS Overview\n\nCSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a language that defines how HTML elements are displayed on a web page. CSS can control the layout, colors, fonts, animations, transitions, and other aspects of the presentation layer of a web page.\n\nCSS works by applying rules to HTML elements that match certain selectors. A selector can be an element name, a class name, an id, an attribute, or a combination of these. A rule consists of a selector and a declaration block. A declaration block contains one or more declarations that specify the properties and values for the selected elements.\n\nFor example, the following CSS rule applies a `red color` and a `24px` font size to **all** paragraphs on a web page:\n\n```css\np {\n  color: red;\n  font-size: 24px;\n}\n```\n\nCSS can be written in three ways: inline, internal, or external.\n\n### Inline CSS\n\nInline CSS is written inside the style attribute of an HTML element.\n\n```html\n<p style=\"color: red; font-size: 24px;\">Hello World!</p>\n```\n\nAnd the result looks the following:\n\n![Inline CSS result](./images/2023-06-16-css-minimum-required-knowledge/inline-css-result.jpg)\n\n### Internal CSS\n\nInternal CSS is written inside the style element in the head section of an HTML document.\n\n```html\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>Internal CSS</title>\n    <style>\n      p {\n        color: red;\n        font-size: 24px;\n      }\n    </style>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <p>Hello World!</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nAnd the result looks the same:\n\n![Internal CSS result](./images/2023-06-16-css-minimum-required-knowledge/internal-css-result.jpg)\n\n### External CSS\n\nExternal CSS is written in a separate file with a `.css` extension and linked to an HTML document using the link element.\n\n```html\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>External CSS</title>\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"style.css\" />\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <p>Hello World!</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n```css\n/* style.css */\np {\n  color: red;\n  font-size: 24px;\n}\n```\n\nNot surprizing, the result looks the same:\n\n![External CSS result](./images/2023-06-16-css-minimum-required-knowledge/external-css-result.jpg)\n\nInline CSS has the highest specificity and overrides any other CSS rules that apply to the same element. External CSS has the lowest specificity and can be overridden by any other CSS rules. Internal CSS has a medium specificity and can override external CSS but not inline CSS.\n\nCSS is a powerful and flexible language that can enhance the appearance and usability of web pages. However, it also has some limitations and challenges. For example, CSS does not have variables, functions, or loops that can make writing and maintaining code easier. CSS also does not have native support for responsive design, which means adapting the layout and content of web pages to different screen sizes and devices. To overcome these limitations and challenges, developers can use preprocessors like [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) or [Less](https://lesscss.org/) that extend the features of CSS or frameworks like [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) or [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) that provide ready-made components and utilities for responsive design.\n\n## CSS Selectors\n\nCSS selectors are patterns that allow us to select HTML elements and apply styles to them.\n\n### Type selector\n\nThis selector matches all elements that have the same tag name. For example, `p` selects all paragraph elements in the document.\n\n```css\n/* Type selector */\np {\n  font-family: Arial;\n}\n```\n\n### Class selector\n\nThis selector matches all elements that have a specific class attribute. For example, `.green-text` selects all elements with `class=\"green-text\"`.\n\n```css\n/* Class selector  */\n.green-text {\n  color: green;\n}\n```\n\n### ID selector\n\nThis selector matches an element that has a unique ID attribute. For example, `#logo` selects the element with `id=\"logo\"`.\n\n```css\n/* ID selector */\n#logo {\n  width: 100px;\n}\n```\n\n### Attribute selector\n\nThis selector matches elements that have a certain attribute or attribute value. For example, `[href]` selects all elements that have an `href` attribute, and `[href^=\"https\"]` selects all elements that have an `href` attribute that starts with \"https\".\n\n```css\n/* Attribute selector */\n[href] {\n  text-decoration: none;\n}\n```\n\n### Pseudo-class selector\n\nThis selector matches elements based on their state or position. For example, `:hover` selects elements when the mouse pointer is over them, and `:first-child` selects elements that are the first child of their parent.\n\n```css\n/* Pseudo-class selector  */\na:hover {\n  color: green;\n}\n```\n\n### Pseudo-element selector\n\nThis selector matches a part of an element or a generated content. For example, `::before` inserts content before an element, and `::first-line` selects the first line of a block element.\n\n```css\n/* Pseudo-element selector */\np::first-line {\n  font-weight: bold;\n}\n```\n\n### Combinator selector\n\nThis selector combines two or more selectors to create a more specific selection. For example, `div p` selects all paragraph elements that are descendants of a `div` element, and `h1 + p` selects all paragraph elements that are immediately after an `h1` element.\n\nThe example below uses the child combinator `(>)` to select all `<li>` elements that are direct children of a `<ul>` element with a class of `.menu`. The child combinator ensures that only the top-level list items are selected, not the nested ones.\n\n```css\nul.menu > li {\n  font-weight: bold;\n  color: blue;\n}\n```\n\nThis selector will apply the style to the list items marked with an asterisk `(*)` in the following HTML:\n\n```html\n<ul class=\"menu\">\n  <li>* Home</li>\n  <li>\n    * About\n    <ul>\n      <li>Our mission</li>\n      <li>Our team</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>* Contact</li>\n</ul>\n```\n\n## CSS properties\n\nOne of the main concepts in CSS is the property. A property is a name-value pair that specifies an aspect of an element's appearance or behavior. For example, the color property sets the text color of an element, and the display property determines how an element is rendered on the page.\n\nThere are hundreds of CSS properties that can be used to style web pages. Some of the most common ones are:\n\n- `background` - sets the background color or image of an element\n- `border` - sets the width, style and color of the element's border\n- `font-family` - sets the font typeface of the element's text\n- `font-size` - sets the font size of the element's text\n- `margin` - sets the space outside the element's border\n- `padding` - sets the space inside the element's border\n- `position` - sets the position of an element relative to its parent or the viewport\n- `width` and `height` - set the dimensions of an element\n\nTo use a CSS property, you need to write a selector that matches the element you want to style, followed by a declaration block that contains one or more property-value pairs. For example:\n\n```css\np {\n  color: blue;\n  font-size: 16px;\n}\n```\n\nThis CSS rule applies to all `<p>` elements on the page and sets their text color to blue and their font size to `16px`.\n\nCSS properties can be grouped into categories based on their function or purpose. Some of these categories are:\n\n- **Box model**: properties that affect the size and spacing of an element's box, such as margin, padding, border, width and height\n- **Typography**: properties that affect the appearance and layout of text, such as font-family, font-size, color, text-align and line-height\n- **Background and border**: properties that affect the background and border of an element, such as background-color, background-image, border-style and border-radius\n- **Positioning and layout**: properties that affect how elements are positioned and arranged on the page, such as position, display, float and flex\n- **Transforms and animations**: properties that enable dynamic effects on elements, such as transform, transition and animation\n\nCSS properties are powerful tools that can help you create beautiful and responsive web pages.

CSS can control the layout, colors, fonts, animations, and other aspects of the visual presentation. CSS can also make web pages responsive to different screen sizes and devices. CSS is one of the core technologies of web development, along with HTML and JavaScript.\n","frontmatter":{"title":"CSS - The minimum required knowledge","date":"2023-06-16T16:42:36.000Z","tags":["development","code","css"],"keywords":["css","css selectors","css properties","css classes"],"featuredImage":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#383868","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/e85eca24dc697909aa744c4f06210e09/3f4ea/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/static/e85eca24dc697909aa744c4f06210e09/f1a3a/cover.jpg 150w,\n/static/e85eca24dc697909aa744c4f06210e09/81bf6/cover.jpg 300w,\n/static/e85eca24dc697909aa744c4f06210e09/3f4ea/cover.jpg 600w","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/e85eca24dc697909aa744c4f06210e09/70dfd/cover.webp 150w,\n/static/e85eca24dc697909aa744c4f06210e09/9b21f/cover.webp 300w,\n/static/e85eca24dc697909aa744c4f06210e09/9ff6b/cover.webp 600w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"}]},"width":600,"height":400}}}},"internal":{"contentFilePath":"/home/runner/work/sergii-dev/sergii-dev/articles/2023-06-16-css-minimum-required-knowledge.mdx"},"fields":{"slug":"/articles/css-minimum-required-knowledge/","readingTime":{"text":"7 min read","minutes":6.78,"time":406800}}}},"pageContext":{"id":"cfa0499a-a81c-5e3b-8797-1ce30fc22d50","frontmatter":{"title":"CSS - The minimum required knowledge","date":"2023-06-16T16:42:36.000Z","published":true,"featuredImage":"./images/2023-06-16-css-minimum-required-knowledge/cover.jpg","categories":["Fundamentals","Development"],"tags":["development","code","css"],"keywords":["css","css selectors","css properties","css classes"]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1739528850","3446427935"],"slicesMap":{}}
