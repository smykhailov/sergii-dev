# Welcome to Sergii Mykhailov's Blog

Hi there, welcome to my personal blog! I'm so glad you stopped by. Here you'll find my thoughts, insights and tips on various topics related to software development and [web accessibility](https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility).

A little bit about me: I'm a principal software engineer with over 20 years of experience in the industry. I've worked with different programming languages (c#, JavaScript, TypeScript, Rust) and technologies (web, mobile, desktop, backend).
I love learning new things and solving challenging problems.

But what I'm most passionate about is web accessibility. I believe that everyone should be able to access and enjoy the web, regardless of their abilities or disabilities.
That's why I always strive to make my websites and applications accessible, user-friendly and inclusive.

On this blog, I'll share with you some of the best practices, tools and resources that I use to make the web a better place for everyone. I hope you'll find them useful and inspiring.
And if you have any questions or feedback, feel free to leave a comment or contact me. I'd love to hear from you!
