# Sergii Mykhailov

An engineer with a passion for building things and 20+ years of experience.
I love to learn new things and share my knowledge with others. I spent almost entire my career
in the enterprise world. Recently I became a big fan of open source and I am always looking
for ways to contribute to the community.

## What I'm working on

I'm currently working on a [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software/)
web client. For a long time I was responsible for building Core Framework for the web client.
Now I'm working on Fundamentals team, which is responsible for the performance and best practices how
to build performant web applications. One of the main goals of the team is to build a set of tools
and libraries that will help developers to build performant web applications. We are also working
on a set of best practices and documentation.

One of the big chunks of my work is related to build [accessible web](https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility) applications. We follow the [WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) standard and we are trying to make our applications as accessible as possible. The big challenge in this area is not just follow the specification, but also to make sure that it is usable and no regressions introduced. We are using [Accessibility Insights](https://accessibilityinsights.io/) to make sure that we are not introducing any regressions.

## What are the main technologies I'm using

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)

## What I'm interested in

- [Web Performance](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance)
- [Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/)
- [Web Standards](https://www.w3.org/standards/)
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)

## What I'm learning

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/)
- [Data Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science)
- [Software Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_architecture)

## Enterprise vs Open Source

Being a long time enterprise developer I have a lot of experience in building **maintainable**
and **scalable** systems. The main focus for long time was of my work on **backend** and **infrastructure**.
There is a big difference between Open Source and Enterprise world. In the Open Source world you
need to build something that works and is **easy to use**. In the Enterprise world you need to build
something that works, is easy to use and is **easy to maintain**. This lead to the difference in
the approach how you design the core of the application or library. In the Open Source world you
add as much features as possible and you try to make it as flexible as possible. In the Enterprise
world you try to make it as simple as possible and less open. It means that one thing should do only
one job and do it well, with less possibilities to configure. Don't get me wrong, I'm not talking
about the product itself, but rather about building blocks, like libraries, frameworks, etc.
