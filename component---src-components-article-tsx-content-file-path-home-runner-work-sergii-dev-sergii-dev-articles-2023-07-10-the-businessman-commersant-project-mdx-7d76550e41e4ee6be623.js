The game is over when one player becomes bankrupt. The game is very simple and I think it is a good start for a beginner.

During the waiting period, the player can find out from the secretary the state of affairs, go to the bank, market, or visit the stock exchange. In the bank, you can both take out a loan and lend at interest. In a merchant's economy, there may be two types of goods - oil and land. Each of them can be bought or sold on the stock exchange. At the same time, oil is required for heating a house, and accordingly, some of its reserves are needed; an unheated house creates the probability that a merchant will get sick and end up in a hospital. Land is taxed and therefore at the end of the month for its ownership, a bill is issued to the player for payment. Each of the goods can change its price once a month on the stock exchange, and thus a merchant can choose moments when they are cheap to buy and expensive to sell. At the same time, random events may occur (for example, bankruptcy of oil companies), which can change the price of goods many times over. At the same time, if a player has goods in stock, then they are subject to the risk of random events (for example, a fire at an oil storage facility can destroy property). Also, land and oil can only be purchased until there is at least one unit of purchased goods in stock. In case of bankruptcy, goods are sold for a third of their price until they run out or until the balance becomes positive.

The game is divided into months, at the end of each of which a balance is drawn up for all operations during the past month, and if it is positive, the tax inspection withdraws the amount of tax according to the current percentage.
