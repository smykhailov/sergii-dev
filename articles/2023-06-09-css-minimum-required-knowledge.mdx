The natural continuation in learning web technologies continues with CSS. [HTML](/articles/html-minimum-required-knowledge) instructs browser what and where to display, but CSS is responsible for the look and feel of the web page. It is the language that describes the style of an HTML document. CSS describes how HTML elements should be displayed. This article will cover the minimum required knowledge to start working with CSS.

## CSS Overview

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a language that defines how HTML elements are displayed on a web page. CSS can control the layout, colors, fonts, animations, transitions, and other aspects of the presentation layer of a web page.

CSS works by applying rules to HTML elements that match certain selectors. A selector can be an element name, a class name, an id, an attribute, or a combination of these. A rule consists of a selector and a declaration block. A declaration block contains one or more declarations that specify the properties and values for the selected elements.

For example, the following CSS rule applies a `red color` and a `24px` font size to **all** paragraphs on a web page:

```css
p {
  color: red;
  font-size: 24px;
}
```

CSS can be written in three ways: inline, internal, or external. Inline CSS is written inside the style attribute of an HTML element. Internal CSS is written inside the style element in the head section of an HTML document. External CSS is written in a separate file with a .css extension and linked to an HTML document using the link element.

Inline CSS has the highest specificity and overrides any other CSS rules that apply to the same element. External CSS has the lowest specificity and can be overridden by any other CSS rules. Internal CSS has a medium specificity and can override external CSS but not inline CSS.

CSS is a powerful and flexible language that can enhance the appearance and usability of web pages. However, it also has some limitations and challenges. For example, CSS does not have variables, functions, or loops that can make writing and maintaining code easier. CSS also does not have native support for responsive design, which means adapting the layout and content of web pages to different screen sizes and devices. To overcome these limitations and challenges, developers can use preprocessors like Sass or Less that extend the features of CSS or frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind that provide ready-made components and utilities for responsive design.
