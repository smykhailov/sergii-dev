After we implemented the [bank logic](/articles/the-businessman-bank-logic), we can move to the next part of the game, which is the **Exchange**.
The exchange logic will be similar in complexity to the bank logic, but we will be able to reuse some techniques and code from the bank logic.

There is no so many changes in compare to the one we did in the bank logic, but as I shown in the previous article, you can look through all the changes
just by using GitHub's [compare feature](https://github.com/smykhailov/the-businessman/compare/v0.12...v0.13).

## UI changes

The modifications we need to make are very small and straightforward, and they do not affect the overall structure of our code.
We can apply the same approach that we have already implemented for the bank logic, which has proven to be effective and reliable.

```html {numberLines: 331}
<div id="buy-land" class="hidden text-smaller text-color-turquoise">
  <div>
    <label for="amount-land-buy">
      How much land do you want to buy:
      <input
        id="amount-land-buy"
        title="Amount of land to buy"
        type="number"
        min="1"
        class="text-color-turquoise"
      />
    </label>
  </div>
</div>
<div id="buy-oil" class="hidden text-smaller text-color-turquoise">
  <div>
    <label for="amount-oil-buy">
      How much oil do you want to buy:
      <input
        id="amount-oil-buy"
        title="Amount of oil to buy"
        type="number"
        min="0"
        class="text-color-turquoise"
      />
    </label>
  </div>
</div>
<p id="exchange-error" class="text-smaller text-color-red"></p>
```

## Handling exchange buy logic

The logic to buy goods is similar to the one which we used in the bank logic.
Based on "o" or "l" key press, we will show the prompt to buy oil or land.
And on "Enter" or "Tab" key press, we will process the purchase.

In this section, we will explain how to implement the logic for buying goods in our game.
The logic for buying goods is similar to the one which we used in the bank logic,
but with some differences. We will use the "o" or "l" keys to let the user choose between buying
oil or land, respectively. Then, we will display a prompt that asks the user how much oil or land
player wants to buy, and the price per unit. The player can enter the amount they want to buy
and press the "Enter" or "Tab" keys to confirm their purchase.

```js {numberLines: 537, diff}
const assignExchangeWindowActions = () => {
  let buyLandProcessing = false;
  let buyOilProcessing = false;

  document.addEventListener(
    "keydown",
    e => {
      const exchangeWindow = document.getElementById("exchange-main");
      if (exchangeWindow.classList.contains("hidden")) {
        return;
      }

      const buyLandKeyBinding = "l";
      const buyOilKeyBinding = "o";

      ...

      const cleanPrompts = () => {  // L559
        ...

        buyLandProcessing = false;  // L568
        buyOilProcessing = false;
      };

      if (
        e.key === buyLandKeyBinding ||
        (e.key === buyLandKeyBinding.toUpperCase() && e.shiftKey)
      ) {
        if (buyOilProcessing) {
          return;
        }

        buyLand.classList.remove("hidden");
        amountLandToBuy.focus();

        buyLandProcessing = true;
      }

      if (
        e.key === buyOilKeyBinding ||
        (e.key === buyOilKeyBinding.toUpperCase() && e.shiftKey)
      ) {
        if (buyLandProcessing) {
          return;
        }

        buyOil.classList.remove("hidden");
        amountOilToBuy.focus();

        buyOilProcessing = true;
      }

      if (e.key === "Enter" || e.key === "Tab") {
        if (buyLandProcessing) {
          ...
        }   //L611

        if (buyOilProcessing) {
          ...
        }  //L629


        cleanPrompts();
        document.getElementById("exchange-main").classList.add("hidden");
      }

      if (e.key === "Escape") {
        cleanPrompts();
      }
    },
    true
  );
};

const assignActionHandlers = () => {
  assignBankWindowActions();
+   assignExchangeWindowActions();
};
```

The purchase will be processed by checking if the user has enough money and updating their inventory accordingly.
If the user does not have enough money, an error message will be shown. We will also handle some edge cases, such as invalid inputs or zero amounts.

Here is the logic to handle the purchase of land:

```js {numberLines: 595}
if (buyLandProcessing) {
  const amountValue = +amountLandToBuy.value;
  const totalLandPrice = amountValue * gameData.currentMonthExchangePrices.land;

  if (totalLandPrice > gameData.accountBalances.accountBalance) {
    amountLandToBuy.value = "";
    exchangeError.innerText = "You do not have enough money.";
    return;
  }

  if (amountValue > 0) {
    gameData.assets.land.amount += amountValue;
    gameData.accountBalances.accountBalance -= totalLandPrice;
  } else {
    return;
  }
}
```

And absolutely the same logic, just with different name of input fields to purchase oil:

```js {numberLines: 613}
if (buyOilProcessing) {
  const amountValue = +amountOilToBuy.value;
  const totalOilPrice = amountValue * gameData.currentMonthExchangePrices.oil;

  if (totalOilPrice > gameData.accountBalances.accountBalance) {
    amountOilToBuy.value = "";
    exchangeError.innerText = "You do not have enough money.";
    return;
  }

  if (amountValue > 0) {
    gameData.assets.oil.amount += amountValue;
    gameData.accountBalances.accountBalance -= totalOilPrice;
  } else {
    return;
  }
}
```

the last step is to update the UI with the new values:

```js {numberLines: 631}
setAccountsBalance(gameData.accountBalances);
```

This concludes our tutorial on how to implement the exchange logic for our application.
I hope you have learned something useful and enjoyed this lesson. If you have any questions or
feedback, please feel free to leave the comment.

## Summary

The sources of the changes as usual are on [GiHub](https://github.com/smykhailov/the-businessman/releases/tag/v0.13).

In the next article, we will implement the logic for the **Market**. It will be simpler as we already have a lot of code to reuse.
