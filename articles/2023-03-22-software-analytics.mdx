I was always inspired by the idea to make developers' more efficient and achieve better code quality to maintain code sanity. I worked with few tools which helped me to achieve some level of it, among them are:

- [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/)
- [StyleCop](https://stylecop.codeplex.com/)
- [FxCop](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb429476.aspx)
- [ESLint](http://eslint.org/)
- [JSHint](http://jshint.com/)

But recently my friend and colleague [Roman Dvornov](https://lahmatiy.github.io/about.me/) explained me that _code sanity_ and _developer's efficiency_ is just a subset of much broader discipline, which named **Software Analytics**. I was surprised that I never heard about it before, but after some research I found out that it is a very interesting and promising field of software development.

## What is Software Analytics?

**Software Analytics** is a relatively young discipline that leverages data-driven techniques to enhance developers' experience, optimize codebase and infrastructure. By analyzing code, repositories, and performance metrics, it provides actionable insights to streamline development processes, pinpoint inefficiencies, and improve overall code quality. This data-centric approach fosters collaboration, boosts productivity, and aids in the detection of potential bottlenecks or technical debt, ultimately leading to a more robust and efficient software ecosystem. Embracing Software Analytics empowers developers to make informed decisions and continuously refine their work, resulting in a more reliable and high-performing end product.

## Purposes to use Software Analytics

**_Software quality assurance:_** by analyzing software metrics, defects, and code coverage, organizations can identify areas of improvement and ensure their software meets quality standards.

**_Project management:_** Software Analytics helps project managers monitor progress, estimate effort and time, and allocate resources more effectively.

**_Developer productivity:_** by analyzing individual and team performance metrics, organizations can identify bottlenecks and opportunities for improvement.

**_User behavior analysis:_** by collecting and analyzing user data, organizations can understand how users interact with their software, identify issues, and make improvements to enhance user experience.

**_Security and compliance:_** Software Analytics can help organizations identify vulnerabilities and ensure their software complies with relevant industry standards and regulations.

**_Software evolution:_** by studying software change data, organizations can better understand the factors that drive software evolution and make more informed decisions about future development.

## Facts about the term

**_Origins:_** the term "Software Analytics" was first introduced by Microsoft Research in 2008, with the goal of using data to provide actionable insights into software development processes and improve software quality.
Multidisciplinary Approach: Software Analytics combines techniques from data mining, machine learning, statistics, information visualization, and software engineering to analyze data produced throughout the software development lifecycle.

**_Key Areas:_** some core areas of focus in Software Analytics include code analysis, repository mining, performance metrics analysis, and infrastructure monitoring, among others.
Tools and Techniques:\*\*\* there is a wide range of tools and techniques employed in Software Analytics, such as static and dynamic code analysis, natural language processing, social network analysis, and traceability analysis.

**_Conferences and Journals:_** the growing interest in Software Analytics has led to the establishment of dedicated conferences and journals, such as the International Conference on Software Analytics (ICSA) and the Journal of Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE)

**_Applications:_** Software Analytics has been successfully applied in various domains, including software maintenance and evolution, defect prediction, process improvement, and team collaboration.
Open Source Initiatives:\*\*\* there are numerous open source projects and tools available for Software Analytics, such as Gource, SonarQube, and GitPrime, which foster community-driven development and knowledge sharing.

**_Industry Adoption:_** many leading tech companies, including Google, Microsoft, and IBM, have recognized the value of Software Analytics and have incorporated it into their development processes, driving further innovation and growth in the field.

## Summary

Overall, Software Analytics aims to provide insights into software systems, their development processes, and their usage, enabling organizations to make data-driven decisions and improve software quality and performance.
