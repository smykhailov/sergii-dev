There are two very different worlds: enterprise and open-source software (OSS). And because of their different nature, rules applied in one don't necessary work in another.

This is because they differentiate in core scenarios:

- Enterprise has stricter requirements on security, data retention, compliance, privacy, etc. Often it also has a longer maintenance period.
- OSS world adopts faster changes, better flexibility, simplicity, etc.

These are nice to have in enterprise but not enough. Compliance, reliability, privacy, security and scale are key in that domain.

Based on the different nature of the problems solved by these two different worlds, the software development is different for them. When you try to apply patterns you used to from your OSS projects it doesn't automatically mean that they will work in the enterprise world the same way. I'd even say more, in most cases they fail. The same is true for the opposite case. Almost no one from OSS world likes to use or work with enterprise tools. And it would be really strange if they would. It is like trying to cut your home garden with a big tractor. Funny right? The same funny will be to try to use just shovel to dig the huge field. The fact that a tool is "in vogue" and being talked about by everyone and used in all OSS projects doesn't mean it is enough or that it will work as expected for an enterprise grade product.

So, why we try to apply this style of work in software development. The same principles works in the other branches too. The closest one for software development is buildings development. They have a good law: skyscraper cannot be built by hut blueprint. Why we do that?

Why I say that, I see a lot of things we take into the project are not correct solutions for the enterprise product. For example, cypress is very nice tool and works for majority of the OSC projects, but it has huge disadvantage in the enterprise world. It doesn't allow to dispatch native keyboard event, this makes impossible to automate the regression verification with keyboard navigation feature, which is the core for accessibility. The request to implement this feature stays in their backlog for ~3 years. On the other side, Selenium/WebDriver solution covers this core scenario and allows us to test our core functionality. But it is not vogue.

In general I think we want enterprise products to be a cool, fast and modern and so we tend to use the cool fast tools the other cool and fast products. But it's an enterprise product, it needs to be much more than that and that should be reflected in very careful choice of tools, libraries, frameworks.

Saying that, let's use appropriate tool and think in advance which one we could use, based on our core scenarios and not on the amount of stars and contributor. Let's contribute to the tools we are using to help them to support our core scenarios.
