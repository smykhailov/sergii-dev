Refactoring is the process of improving the quality of existing code without changing its functionality.
It can make your code more readable, maintainable, and testable, as well as reduce bugs and errors.
In this blog post, we will explore what refactoring is, why it is important, and how to use it in JavaScript.

Refactoring can be done at different levels of granularity, from renaming a variable to extracting a function
to applying a design pattern. Some common refactoring techniques are:

- **Extracting variables or constants**: This can help you avoid repeating hard-coded values or complex expressions,
  and give them meaningful names.
- **Extracting functions**: This can help you break down a long or complicated function into smaller and simpler ones,
  each with a single responsibility.
- **Renaming variables, functions, or parameters**: This can help you make your code more consistent and descriptive,
  and avoid confusion or ambiguity.
- **Replacing conditional logic with polymorphism**: This can help you eliminate long or nested if-else statements,
  and use object-oriented principles to handle different behaviors based on types or states.
- **Moving functions or variables**: This can help you organize your code better, and group related elements together.
- **Simplifying boolean expressions**: This can help you make your code more readable and concise, and avoid unnecessary
  or redundant conditions.

Refactoring in JavaScript can be done manually or with the help of tools. Manual refactoring requires careful
attention and testing, as you might introduce errors or change the behavior of your code unintentionally.
Tools can automate some of the refactoring tasks, such as renaming or formatting, and alert you of potential issues or conflicts.
Some popular tools for refactoring JavaScript are:

- **[ESLint](https://eslint.org/)**: This is a linter that can detect and fix common syntax and style errors, as well as
  enforce best practices and coding standards.
- **[Prettier](https://prettier.io/)**: This is a formatter that can automatically format your code according to a set of rules,
  and ensure consistency and readability.
- **[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)**: This is an editor that has built-in support for refactoring JavaScript,
  such as extracting variables or functions, renaming elements, or moving code around.

Refactoring is not a one-time activity, but a continuous practice that should be done regularly and incrementally.
It can help you keep your code clean and healthy, and improve your productivity and performance.
Refactoring in JavaScript can be easier and faster with the use of tools, but it still requires human judgment and testing.
Remember to always refactor with a purpose, and not just for the sake of it.

## Apply refactoring

Now, when we know what refactoring is about, Let's apply some of techniques to the code from [previous article](/articles/the-businessman-basic-interactivity/).

First of all let's extract some functions. We can see a lot of repeating code to get the element and display some data:

```javascript
const todayDateElement = document.getElementById("today-date");
const todayDayOfWeekElement = document.getElementById("today-day-of-week");

todayDateElement.innerText = currentDate;
todayDayOfWeekElement.innerText = dayOfWeek;
```

Instead of repeating this code, we can make a function that will do it for us:

```javascript
const setElementData = (elementId, data) => {
  const element = document.getElementById(elementId);
  element.innerText = data;
};
```

now we can replace all the places where we were repeating the code with the function:

```javascript
setInterval(() => {
  ...
  setElementData('today-date', currentDate);
  setElementData('today-day-of-week', dayOfWeek);
  ...
}, 2000);
```

Now it looks much cleaner and more maintainable. But still not perfect, there are still
a lot of this functions comming in blocks, not grouped by functionality. Let's fix this by grouping
and naming them more appropriately:

```javascript
const setTodayView = today => {
  const currentDate = today.toLocaleDateString("en-US");
  const dayOfWeek = today.toLocaleDateString("en-US", { weekday: "long" });
  const dayOfWeekNum = today.getDay();

  setElementData("today-date", currentDate);
  setElementData("today-day-of-week", dayOfWeek);

  updateDayOfWeekColor(dayOfWeekNum);
};
```

Similar way we can group and name the functions that are responsible for displaying account balances, taxes and interest rates:

```javascript
const setInterestRates = () => {
  setElementData("credit-interest-rate", creditInterestRate.toFixed(0));
  setElementData("debit-interest-rate", debitInterestRate.toFixed(0));
  setElementData("income-tax", incomeTax.toFixed(0));
};

const setAccountsBalance = () => {
  setElementData("account-balance", accountBalance.toFixed(0));
  setElementData("credit-balance", creditBalance.toFixed(0));
  setElementData("deposit-balance", depositBalance.toFixed(0));
  setElementData("net-income", netIncome.toFixed(0));
};

const setTaxes = () => {
  setElementData("house-tax", houseTax.toFixed(0));
  setElementData("land-tax", landTax.toFixed(0));
};
```

There is one problem with this approach, the previous function depends on the global variables, and we'd like to avoid that.
This is important, because we can decouple the functions from the global state, and make them more reusable.

To do that we can pass the data as arguments to the functions:

```javascript
const setInterestRates = interestRates => {
  setElementData(
    "credit-interest-rate",
    interestRates.creditInterestRate.toFixed(0)
  );
  setElementData(
    "debit-interest-rate",
    interestRates.debitInterestRate.toFixed(0)
  );
  setElementData("income-tax", interestRates.incomeTax.toFixed(0));
};

const setAccountsBalance = accountBalances => {
  setElementData("account-balance", accountBalances.accountBalance.toFixed(0));
  setElementData("credit-balance", accountBalances.creditBalance.toFixed(0));
  setElementData("deposit-balance", accountBalances.depositBalance.toFixed(0));
  setElementData("net-income", accountBalances.netIncome.toFixed(0));
};

const setTaxes = taxes => {
  setElementData("house-tax", taxes.houseTax.toFixed(0));
  setElementData("land-tax", taxes.landTax.toFixed(0));
};
```

Now we need to refactor our global variables, and put them into structures, in the future we can move them to the separate file, to decouple data,
buisinss logic and presentation.

```javascript
const interestRates = {
  debitInterestRate: Math.random() * 10 + 5,
  incomeTax: Math.random() * 9 + 1,
  creditInterestRate: Math.random() * 10 + 5,
};

const accountBalances = {
  accountBalance: Math.random() * 10000 + 1000,
  creditBalance: 0,
  depositBalance: 0,
  netIncome: 0,
};

const taxes = {
  houseTax: Math.random() * 19 + 1,
  landTax: Math.random() * 19 + 1,
};
```

Let's also extract our data coloring logic to the separate function:

```javascript
const updateDayOfWeekColor = dayOfWeekNum => {
  const todayDayOfWeekElement = document.getElementById("today-day-of-week");
  if (dayOfWeekNum === 0) {
    todayDayOfWeekElement.classList.add("sunday");
  } else if (dayOfWeekNum === 6) {
    todayDayOfWeekElement.classList.add("saturday");
  } else {
    todayDayOfWeekElement.classList.remove("sunday");
    todayDayOfWeekElement.classList.remove("saturday");
  }
};
```

And now our main game loop, looks nice, simple and more maintainable:

```javascript
setInterval(() => {
  setTodayView(today);
  setInterestRates(interestRates);
  setAccountsBalance(accountBalances);
  setTaxes(taxes);

  today.setDate(today.getDate() + 1);
}, 2000);
```

## Summary

This is just a small example of refactoring, but it shows how we can improve our code, and make it more maintainable.
These techniques are usefull as it allows developers to use Single Responisbility Principle (SRP), which I'll describe
in one of the future articles.

As usual you can find refactored version of the code, on the [GitHub](https://github.com/smykhailov/the-businessman/releases/tag/v0.4).
In the next article we will continue to add more interactivity to our game.
